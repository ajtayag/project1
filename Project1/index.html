            <h3>The Road Not Taken</h3>
            <p>By Robert Frost</p>
            <p>
              Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel
              both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far
              as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;
            </p>

            <p>
              Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the
              better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for
              that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,
            </p>
            <p>
              And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden
              black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way
              leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.
            </p>
            <p>
              I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence:
              Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled
              by, And that has made all the difference
            </p>
